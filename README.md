# Minesweeper
Minesweeper is a command-line based implementation of the classic Minesweeper game. The game generates a minefield of designated dimensions and number of bombs, which the player must clear while avoiding detonating the bombs. The game is run from the driver class, and can either be seeded with a seed file or have the field generated by entering the dimensions and number of bombs at runtime.

The game provides a set of commands and formatting, which are displayed after the board is created and the game is started. Entering 'h' or 'help' will provide the commands again. To run the game, simply execute the driver class.
