# Minesweeper
Minesweeper is a command-line based implementation of the classic Minesweeper game. The game generates a minefield of designated dimensions and number of bombs, which the player must clear while avoiding detonating the bombs. The minefield can be generated either by providing a seed file or by entering the dimensions and number of bombs at runtime. Users can also manually enter commands or use an input file. The "test" folder contains several seed and input files along with their expected results and error messages for testing purposes.

The game provides a set of commands and formatting, which are displayed after the board is created and the game is started. Entering 'h' or 'help' will provide the commands again. To run the game, simply execute the driver class.
